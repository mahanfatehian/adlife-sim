## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-22

Initial development release of the complete research instrument.

### Added

- **Core model** — frozen, strictly validated domain contracts; deterministic
  minute-by-minute clock; keyed random oracle; ten-zone routable world; two-phase
  movement planning; fictional population, routine, and relationship-graph generation
  from packaged templates.
- **Behaviour** — campaign ingestion with safe YAML and path containment; exposure
  opportunity, impression, and attention; rule-bounded response, memory encoding with
  five-slot salience retention, daily decay, social influence over relationship edges,
  and a rule-only purchase proxy.
- **Cognition** — ports with rules, mock, and OpenAI-compatible hybrid providers;
  budgeted, cached, retried service; terminal rule fallback; every fallback recorded as
  an event; replay answers from the recorded cache.
- **Persistence** — event sinks, SQLite store, manifests recording version, scenario
  fingerprint, provider, seed, and model parameters; replayable run artifacts
  (`events.jsonl`, `results.sqlite3`, `run.json`, `metrics.json`, `provider-usage.json`,
  frozen `inputs/`).
- **Orchestration** — whole-run runner with atomic nine-stage tick commit, checkpoints,
  interruption recording, and an optional per-tick observer seam.
- **Experiments** — the metrics fold (every value with numerator, denominator, and
  sources), paired A/B comparisons under common random numbers with an A/A exactly-zero
  guarantee, no-campaign anchoring, and one-knob sensitivity sweeps with rank-flip
  reporting.
- **CLI** — `init`, `validate`, `population generate`, `campaign import`, `run`,
  `replay`, `compare`, `doctor`, `report`, `demo` under the global
  `--format human|json|jsonl` output contract with documented exit codes.
- **Live dashboard** — a read-only Textual TUI (agent table, details and memories,
  bounded event stream, metrics strip) driven through the same loop as headless runs,
  with pause/step/speed/filter controls and headless fallback off-terminal.
- **Reports** — self-contained offline HTML reports (inlined Plotly, no remote
  resources, escaped chart payloads) with the synthetic-data disclosure, full metrics
  provenance, fictional diaries, and the reproduction manifest.
- **Documentation** — ODD protocol, model card, pre-registered experiment protocol,
  limitations, architecture, reproducibility, quickstart, CLI reference, and the
  five-minute demonstration script.

### Security

- Untrusted-input posture for campaign and population files (safe YAML, strict schemas,
  project-root path containment); minimised provider prompts; secret redaction in logs;
  reports escape user-provided text and embed no remote scripts.
